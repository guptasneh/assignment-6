# Pollution & Energy Recovery Analysis

This project compares K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and Neural Networks  
to analyze pollution data and predict energy recovery across countries.

K-Means groups countries into 3 clusters based on pollution and energy use.  
Hierarchical Clustering shows how similar countries are pollution-wise.  
Neural Network predicts how much energy (GWh) can be recovered.

Insights help target environmental strategies per cluster.  
Combined models give better forecasting and planning.

Tools Used: Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas, Matplotlib  
Output: Country clusters, prediction accuracy, and policy suggestions.  
Goal: Smarter pollution control and energy planning.
